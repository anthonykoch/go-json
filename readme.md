# JSON Parser

My first time using golang. Parses JSON into an AST. Took 12 hours.

- ~3 hours were spent building and debugging the regexes.
- ~6 hours were spent reading documentation.
- and the rest was actually writing the lexer and parser/fixing silly off by one errors

Parser is not completely to spec. Don't use it. Thanks.
